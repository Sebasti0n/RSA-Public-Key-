# RSA-Public-Private-Key-Generator
This program uses the RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) public key algorithm
RSA Public Key algorithm that takes two keys and generates a public and a private key based on two integers that are inputed by the user

p - input for p
q - input for q
modulus is n = p * q 
Totient function represented by  n Ï•(n)
(p-1)(q-1) = theta n 



The algorithm will calculate the RSA private key by using the Euclidean algorithm. 

This program also uses RSA keys to digitally sign a message, user A would need to create a hash (a message digest) to user B.
